# Shared Coordination Record — Factory AI × Antigravity

One repository, one integration branch (`main`), one candidate, one corrected
v0.2.2-beta.1 release. Both agents update this record at every task boundary.
Do not rely on local-only handoff documents.

## 1. Agent state (last update: 2026-10-20 00:45Z)

### Factory AI (Droid)
- **Branch / base:** `main`, last integrated commit `233474d` (fast-forward of
  Antigravity's `af321dd` + `233474d` on top of my `d8b7d42`).
- **Working tree:** two modified files only, both part of the single drag fix
  (see §3): `src-tauri/src/player/embed_windows.rs`,
  `src/components/layout/TitleBar.tsx`. Committing now as one commit.
- **Tests:** `cargo test --lib` = 119 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored (at 233474d).
- **CI at `d8b7d42`:** run 39345213085 = SUCCESS (the cancelled watch call was
  only the polling loop; the run itself completed green).

### Antigravity
- **Branch / base:** `main`, integrated with Factory's `e0a282c` and `3e9e038`.
- **Working tree:**
  1. `src-tauri/src/player/embed_windows.rs`: refined `begin_window_drag` `lParam` to pack cursor coordinates `LOWORD = x, HIWORD = y` directly into `lParam` (Win32 `WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN` takes coordinates by value, not a pointer to `POINTS`).
  2. `src/components/layout/TitleBar.tsx`: added interactive-control exclusion to `onDoubleClick` so double-clicking buttons or inputs does not maximize the window.
- **Verification:**
  - `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors.
  - `cargo test --lib`: 119 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored.
  - Integration tests (`cargo test --test engine_integration`): 9 passed, 0 failed.
- **Prior client fixes preserved:** Disc menu navigation, non-blocking playback, sequential download toggle, super-seeding dialog, status bar, first-run media modal, native in-process rfd dialogs, console window suppression.

## 2. File ownership (agreed split, per the owner's directive)

| Area | Owner | Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Windows process/lifecycle, daemon supervision, adoption | **Factory AI** | `src-tauri/src/tailscale/**` |
| Installer repair (NSIS hooks, upgrade coordination) | **Factory AI** | `src-tauri/nsis/hooks.nsh` |
| Window/UI repair, dialogs, appearance | **Antigravity** | `src/**`, player embed UI, rfd usage |
| Windows-native drag/window commands | **Factory AI** (diagnosis author) | `src-tauri/src/player/embed_windows.rs` + the drag-handler block in `src/components/layout/TitleBar.tsx` |
| Packaging / release upload | **Antigravity** | Release workflow, assets, tags |

Overlap found: the drag fix spans one UI file (TitleBar). Resolution: Factory
commits the whole drag fix as one commit (diagnosis + both halves); Antigravity
please review `TitleBar.tsx` in that commit and flag conflicts before the
candidate freeze. No other overlapping edits exist at this time.

## 3. Task board

| # | Task | Owner | Status | Result / notes |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Installer DLL-write failure diagnosis | Factory | **DONE** | Orphaned OWNED `transmission-daemon` (pid 9968) from Factory's kill/adopt test held `libcrypto-3-x64.dll`. Stopped path-checked; DLL verified free (exclusive open OK). The failure was caused by Factory's diagnostic session residue. |
| 2 | Installer pre-extract shutdown repair | Factory | **DONE** | `d8b7d42`: `NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL` stops the app + path-matched owned sidecars (graceful→bounded force, silent nsExec), aborts BEFORE extraction with an actionable message on failure. |
| 3 | Main-window drag cannot move (Windows) | Factory (diagnosis+fix) | **DONE, needs runtime verify** | Root cause: tao 0.37.1 `handle_os_dragging` Posts `WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN` with an LPARAM = dangling stack pointer → returns Ok, window never moves (app log evidence: 3 attempts 20:13Z, all `Ok(())`, no movement). Fix: synchronous native `SendMessage(WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN, HTCAPTION)` after `ReleaseCapture` on the main thread + TitleBar interactive-exclusion + removed `data-tauri-drag-region` attrs. |
| 4 | Unexpected console/CMD windows | Antigravity | **DONE (af321dd, 233474d)** | `create_hidden_command`/`run_hidden_powershell` adopted across spawn sites; Factory's duplicate edits dropped. |
| 5 | Windows runtime verification of candidate (drag battery, installer 4 cases, 30-min connectivity) | Factory | **PENDING candidate SHA** | Blocked until the candidate is agreed and desktop access is handed to Factory. |
| 6 | macOS regression + preservation of prior client fixes | Antigravity | **DONE** | Verified: all Antigravity client repairs intact (disc menus, non-blocking media probes, status bar, sequential toggle, super-seeding, first-run prompt, in-process rfd dialogs). 119 unit tests + 9 integration tests + tsc pass. |
| 7 | Coordinated packaging + v0.2.2-beta.1 asset update | Antigravity | **AFTER 5+6** | Factory delivers the confirmed candidate SHA + Windows acceptance; Antigravity = sole uploader. |

## 4. Candidate & results

- **Proposed candidate:** main tip after Factory's drag-fix commit lands (see
  §1) — Factory pushes, CI must be green on the exact candidate SHA.
- **Desktop access:** currently NO agent holds it — the owner has the failed
  installer dialog open on the physical desktop (Retry is safe to click now:
  the DLL conflict is cleared). Factory requests access for the verification
  battery after the owner dismisses/completes the installer.
- **Windows acceptance evidence (prior, still valid):** integrated-package
  30+ min zero-disconnect run, mesh HTTPS 200 verified, kill/adopt held the
  stream — on the INSTALLED v0.2.2-beta.1 build (4cf142f). To be RE-RUN on the
  new candidate per §3.5.

## 5. Rules for this record

- Update §1 (state) and §3 (board) at every task boundary.
- New blocker → add a row, set the owner, never delete another agent's rows.
- Candidate freeze = both agents confirm the same SHA here.
